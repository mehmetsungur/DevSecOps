Congratulations on reaching the end of this course,
Introduction to DevSecOps for the Cloud.
And if you're interested in cloud application security,
I have a course called Hands-On Security for GCP Developers,
that has tons of hands-on labs
for securing your GCP environment and workloads.
One last thing before we go.
I wanna encourage you to engage with the community
and leave some feedback for this course.
Thank you for joining me on this journey
as we learned about DevSecOps for the Cloud
and congratulations on completing this course.
