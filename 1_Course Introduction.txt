Hello, and welcome to the course,
Introduction to DevSecOps for Cloud.
I'm Chris Jackson,
and I'll be your security training architect
for this course.
A little bit about me,
I'm a certified information system security professional
with over a decade of experience in the IT field.
I'm also an avid gamer, basketball fan and drone enthusiast.
Now I've structured this course
around the DevSecOps lifecycle.
Next, we'll learn about the planning, coding, building
and testing stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle.
And last, we'll learn about the releasing, deploying,
monitoring and responding stages of the DevSecOps Lifecycle.
I've gone ahead and included some practical demos
that will aid you with the hands-on labs
that accompany this course.
So by the end of this course,
you'll be able to apply the DevSecOps methodology
for your software development and apps running in the cloud.
Now, before we begin our journey,
let's go over some prerequisites.
It's important that you have a fundamental understanding
around cloud computing concepts and a basic understanding
around cybersecurity and software development.
So with that out the way, let's start our journey
by learning about DevSecOps for the cloud.
